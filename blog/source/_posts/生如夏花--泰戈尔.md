### 《生如夏花》
生命，一次又一次轻薄过
轻狂不知疲倦
　　 ——题记
    1
我听见回声，来自山谷和心间
以寂寞的镰刀收割空旷的灵魂
不断地重复决绝，又重复幸福
终有绿洲摇曳在沙漠
我相信自己
生来如同璀璨的夏日之花
不凋不败，妖冶如火
承受心跳的负荷和呼吸的累赘
乐此不疲
<!-- more -->　　
2
我听见音乐，来自月光和胴体
辅极端的诱饵捕获飘渺的唯美
一生充盈着激烈，又充盈着纯然
总有回忆贯穿于世间
我相信自己
死时如同静美的秋日落叶
不盛不乱，姿态如烟
即便枯萎也保留丰肌清骨的傲然
玄之又玄
3
我听见爱情，我相信爱情
爱情是一潭挣扎的蓝藻
如同一阵凄微的风
穿过我失血的静脉
驻守岁月的信念
4
我相信一切能够听见
甚至预见离散，遇见另一个自己
而有些瞬间无法把握
任凭东走西顾，逝去的必然不返
请看我头置簪花，一路走来一路盛开
频频遗漏一些，又深陷风霜雨雪的感动
5
般若波罗蜜，一声一声
生如夏花，死如秋叶
还在乎拥有什么
（郑振铎译）

原版：
Life, thin and light-off time and time again
Frivolous tireless

one
I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart
Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting
Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of
Eventually swaying in the desert oasis

I believe I am
Born as the bright summer flowers
Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule
Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome
Bored

Two
I heard the music, from the moon and carcass
Auxiliary extreme aestheticism bait to capture misty
Filling the intense life, but also filling the pure
There are always memories throughout the earth

I believe I am
Died as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves
Sheng is not chaos, smoke gesture
Even wilt also retained bone proudly Qing Feng muscle
Occult

Three
I hear love, I believe in love
Love is a pool of struggling blue-green algae
As desolate micro-burst of wind
Bleeding through my veins
Years stationed in the belief

Four
I believe that all can hear
Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own
Some can not grasp the moment
Left to the East to go West, the dead must not return to nowhere

See, I wear Zan Flowers on my head, in full bloom along the way all the way
Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain

Five
Prajna Paramita, soon as soon as
life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves
Also care about what has
